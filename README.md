Basic Full Stack (Front End React)

 1st Commit - Gained basic functionality of website (again, and commited to gitHub this time!)

2nd Commit - refactored some of the code and started with the update function

3rd Commit - Forgot to save README!

4th Commit - added some CSS, began creating a profile page to house various functions, started a logout function, and I'm reasonably certain that I've fixed the login function (hopefully it stays fixed this time)

5th Commit - Set up the React Router to make navigation across the site more efficient
